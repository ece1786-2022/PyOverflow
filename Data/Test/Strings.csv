<p>Preferably the code would be in Python.</p>
<h3>Background:</h3>
<p>This seems like a simple problem on the surface, but I'm kind of struggling with it:</p>
<ul>
<li>Clearly, the midpoint string between &quot;A&quot; and &quot;C&quot; would be &quot;B&quot;.</li>
<li>With base64 encoding, the midpoint string between &quot;A&quot; and &quot;B&quot; would probably be &quot;Ag&quot;</li>
<li>With UTF-8 encoding, I'm not sure what the valid midpoint would be because the middle character seems to be a control character: <code>U+0088        c2 88   &lt;control&gt;</code></li>
</ul>
<h3>Practical Application:</h3>
<p>The reason I am asking is because I was hoping write map-reduce type algorithm to read all of the entries out of our database and process them. The primary keys in the database are UTF-8 encoded strings with random distributions of characters. The database we are using is Cassandra.</p>
<p>Was hoping to get the lowest key and the highest key out of the database, then break that up into two ranges by finding the midpoint, then breaking those two ranges up into two smaller sections by finding each of their midpoints until I had a few thousand sections, then I could read each section asynchronously.</p>
<p><strong>Example if the strings were base-16 encoded:</strong> (Some of the midpoints are approximate):</p>
<pre>
Starting highest and lowest keys:  '000'                'FFF'
                                   /   \              /       \
                              '000'     '8'         '8'       'FFF'
                              /   \     /  \       /  \       /   \
Result:                  '000'    '4' '4'  '8'   '8'  'B8'  'B8'  'FFF'
(After 3 levels of recursion)

The characterization always begins from the beginning of the word.

i was thinking of sorting the words, and grouping based on the fist alphabetical letter, then probably use a longest common subsequence algorithm to find the longest subsequence in common, take its length and use length+1 chars for that unique substring, but im stuck since the algorithms i know for longest subsequence will usually only take two parameters at a time, and i may have more than two words in each group starting with a particular alphabetical letter.

<p>The question said:
""Define a function postalValidate(S) which first checks if S represents a postal code which is valid:
first, delete all spaces;
the remainder must be of the form L#L#L# where L are letters (in either lower or upper case) and # are numbers.
If S is not a valid postal code, return the boolean False. If S is valid, return a version of the same postal code in the nice format L#L#L# where each L is capital.""</p>

<p>and this is my working for this question:</p>

<pre><code>def postalValidate(S):
   if S.count(' ') &gt; 0:
      S.replace(' ', '')
   if S.isalpha() or S.isdigit() == True:

         else:

<p>All the inputs were correct except this postalValidate('  d3  L3  T3').
I used S.count to identify how many ' ' are there in the input, but it didn't work. Instead, the input turned out to be 'd3L3T3' right after it goes into the function.</p>

The string comes from a tuplified Pandas Dataframe and shall be inserted via
sqlalchemy/pyodbc. Since the Panda Dataframe ""to_sql"" method is to slow I wanted to insert values in a batch of 1000 and built the following method (in accordance to a tutorial found on the web):</p>

<pre><code>def chunker(seq, size):
return (seq[pos:pos + size] for pos in range(0, len(seq), size))

def mssql_insert_rows(records,db_extract, target_tbl):
insert_ = ""INSERT INTO dbo.""+ db_extract+ ""_""+ target_tbl+ "" VALUES ""
for batch in chunker (records, 1000):

    rows = ','.join(batch)
    insert_rows = insert_+rows
    cursorSQL.execute(insert_rows)
    connSQL.commit()
</code></pre>

<p>This is how the string looks like:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>(\'2\', \'10\', \'41\', \'null\', \'null\', \'null\', \'None\', \'FR\', ""Saint-ouen l\'aumône           "", \'2013_07M\', \'False\', \'True\', \'113706\', \'1990-01-01 00:00:00.0\', \'2013-04-30 00:00:00.0\', \'9AAE305417\', \'null\', \'None\', \'False\', \'False\')</p>
</blockquote>

<p>As cou can see the value ""Saint-ouen l\'aumône "" is quite bad for inserting since the program now thinks it's the name of a column. I tried different approaches like df.replace or str.replace to solve this problem but nothing really gets me to a solution.</p>

<p>Does anyone here know a good and easy way to convert values like this one?
I personally wouldn't mind if the value looks like</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Saint-ouen laumone</p>
</blockquote>

<p>or so.</p>

I do not want to dump the whole <code>self.response_context</code> into the string, because this is a <code>TextField</code> with <code>max_length=4000</code>, so it can get very big! I want to have just the first 10 characters of this field to be displayed as a string, so that I can just look and immediately remember what was the rest of the <code>response_content</code> from these displayed characters.

<p>At the third one though, I noticed I'm getting a <code>ValueError: '5' is not in list</code> because the when the double digit numbers are getting put into the evens and odds lists, they're getting broken down further into their digits. <code>""8""</code> and <code>""8""</code> are getting put into evens, rather than <code>""88""</code>, so the first entry in the odds list, <code>odds[0]</code>, is <code>'5'</code> rather than <code>'51'</code>.

First column is suppose to be all numbers.  If letters exist in the column1 (anywhere in the value) then cut&amp;paste value to 'Column3' within the same row.  I have figured out how to use .loc to filter column for certain values and successfully applied text in column3 saying &quot;value has letters&quot;. But can not place code together with the idea to say ( if column1 value != isdigit then cut&amp;paste value to column3 same row).  My current test code searches column1, finds letters in value, then moves value to column3 at bottom of column which I do not want.  I would appreciate some insight on how to use .loc and isdigit together, not sure.  Thanks for taking the time.</p>

<p>The code above will pick up the value with letters in Column1 and move them to the bottom of Column3. It at least gets the values now I have to figure .loc out to cut from column1 and paste into column3 same row.  Below is a picture of what I would like to have happen.</p>

def alphapinDecode(tone):

   print(pin)

   return None

<p>For the most part the function runs exactly how I want it to. I take a string and it returns numbers as a string.</p>

<p>For example: </p>

<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; alphapinDecode('bomelela')
3464140
</code></pre>

<p>But when I do this one:</p>

<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; alphapinDecode('bomeluco')
</code></pre>

<p>it returns 346448 instead of the 3464408 like it is supposed to do (according to my assignment). Now I know the function is giving me the correct answer based on the code, but what am I missing to have it include the 0 before the 8? </p>

<p>EDIT:</p>

<p>Function is supposed to take the string that you pass(tone) and break it up into 2 letter chunks(vowel/consonant pair). With the pair, it is supposed to use the pair and index them with vowels/consonants and return a number. >>>alphapinDecode('hi') returns 27 because consonants[h] gives idx = 5 while vowels[i] gives idx2 = 2</p>

        managed = False
        db_table = 'teachers'
</code></pre>

<p>The admin panel still shows the teachers listed as  Teachers object (1275) (and so on). </p>

<p>I have tried the following:
1. Running the makemigrations and migrate commands
2. Logging in and out of the admin panel
3. Refreshing and closing down CMD - restarting</p>

<p>None of the above has worked. There are no errors on running the server. 
Python version: <strong>3.7</strong> Latest Django installation</p>

<p>Considerations:
1. I was using a legacy mysql database so reverse created the models. Could this be affecting anything?
2 I wonder if the class Meta (at the bottom) has any bearing on the error.</p>

<p>I also tried the following, but still no result:</p>

<pre><code>def __str__(self):
    return '%s %s' %(self.username,self.email)
</code></pre>

<p>For reference, and in case this is relevant here is my admin.py</p>

<pre><code>from django.contrib import admin

# Register your models here.

from django.contrib import admin
from .models import Teachers
from .models import TeacherPins
admin.site.register(Teachers)
admin.site.register(TeacherPins)
</code></pre>

<p>Finally, as this is a reverse-generated model (from a legacy mysql) Django provided this advice at the start of the models.py file. Again, could this (not being done, e.g <strong>not having a primary key</strong> etc) have a bearing on the <strong>str</strong> method not working?</p>

<pre><code># This is an auto-generated Django model module.
# You'll have to do the following manually to clean this up:
#   * Rearrange models' order
#   * Make sure each model has one field with primary_key=True
#   * Make sure each ForeignKey has `on_delete` set to the desired behavior.
#   * Remove `managed = False` lines if you wish to allow Django to create, modify, and delete the table
# Feel free to rename the models, but don't rename db_table values or field names.
</code></pre>

<p><strong>Update:</strong> </p>

<ol>
<li>I did try rearranging the order (of the classes) - would this make a difference? But still the object remained an object</li>
<li><p>I tried adding a primary key to both classes - this didn't work either</p>

<p>student_id = models.IntegerField(blank=True, null=True, primary_key=True)</p></li>

<p>This is too good, and I wonder why it should work. My confusion comes from the following.</p>

<p>But they are different.</p>
