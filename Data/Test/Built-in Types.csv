<p>I'm following up on <a href=""https://stackoverflow.com/questions/1566936/easy-pretty-printing-of-floats-in-python/1567630#1567630"">this answer</a>:</p>

<pre><code>class prettyfloat(float):
  def __repr__(self):
    return ""%0.2f"" % self
</code></pre>

<p>I know I need to keep track of my float literals (i.e., replace <code>3.0</code> with  <code>prettyfloat(3.0)</code>, etc.), and that's fine.</p>

<p>But whenever I do any calculations, <code>prettyfloat</code> objects get converted into <code>float</code>.</p>

<p>What's the easiest way to fix it?</p>

<p>EDIT:</p>

<p>I need exactly two decimal digits; and I need it across the whole code, including where I print a dictionary with <code>float</code> values inside. That makes any formatting functions hard to use.</p>

<p>I can't use <code>Decimal</code> global setting, since I want computations to be at full precision (just printing at 2 decimal points).</p>

<p>@Glenn Maynard: I agree I shouldn't override <code>__repr__</code>; if anything, it would be just <code>__str__</code>. But it's a moot point because of the following point.</p>

<p>@Glenn Maynard and @singularity: I won't subclass <code>float</code>, since I agree it will look very ugly in the end.</p>

<p>I will stop trying to be clever, and just call a function everywhere a <code>float</code> is being printed. Though I am really sad that I can't override <code>__str__</code> in the builtin class <code>float</code>.</p>

<p>Thank you!</p>

<pre><code>self.code = sets.code

run()

help much appreciated.</p>

  <p>Edit:
  So how should i approach this if i need to <code>import settings</code> in <code>main</code> but only run() settings whenever i start running the main_run() and than just get the variables? 
  I dont want to complicate it with saving to file and than reading a list() i need to just access them and only run</p>
  
  <p>basicaly: my settings gets a long list from pickle and than makes some operations that return the code combination and lots of other self.settings that need to be initiated when the program(main) starts and than for the whole While True inside run() the values are fixed unless i start refresh_settings() and change the settings than the data is recompiled and the program returns to while true</p>

An example assignment is where I want students to write two functions - one called <code>insert_sorted()</code> that adds an element to the list so that the list remains sorted, and another called <code>insertion_sort()</code> which returns a new list and uses <code>insert_sorted()</code> for sorting.</p>

<p>My access to the students' code is through unit test cases, in which I can call these functions. The problem is that in the <code>insert_sorted()</code> function, students can use <code>list.sort()</code> method and in the <code>insertion_sorted()</code> function, they can use <code>sorted()</code> built-in function.</p>

<p>It's easy to override the built-in functions (which in this case can raise an exception with the message that their use is not allowed). I can also override objects and functions in built-in modules (e.g., I needed to prevent the use of <code>math.factorial()</code> function). But I cannot replace the method of a built-in type, like in the code below:</p>

<pre><code>def error():
    raise Exception(""Not allowed."")
list.sort = error

<p>I get the error:</p>

  <p>This is prohibited intentionally to prevent accidental fatal changes to built-in types (fatal to parts of the code that you never though of). Also, it is done to prevent the changes to affect different interpreters residing in the address space, since built-in types (unlike user-defined classes) are shared between all such interpreters.</p>

<p>When I say 'implicitly', what I mean is that when I declare 'a = 1', and object of the type Custom_Int (as an example) is produced, as opposed to a normal integer object.</p>

<p>Now, I understand and respect the reasons not to do this. Firstly- messing with built-ins is like messing with the laws of physics. No good can come from it. That said- I do understand the gravity of what I'm trying to do and what can happen if I do it wrong.</p>

<p>Second- I understand that modifying a base case will effect not just the current run-time but all running python processes. I feel that by overriding the __new__ method of these base classes, such that it returns Custom_Object_Whatever if and ONLY IF certain environmental factors are true, other run times will remain largely unaffected.</p>

<p>So, getting back to the issue at hand- how can I override the __new__ method of these various types?</p>

<p>Pythons forbiddenfruit package seems to be promising. I havn't had a chance to reeeeeeally investigate it though, and if someone who understands it could summarize what it does, that would save me a lot of time.</p>

<p>Beyond that, I've observed something strange. </p>

<p>Every answer to monkeypatching that doesn't eventually circle back to forbiddenfruit or how forbiddenfruit works has to do with modifying what I will refer to as the 'absolute_dictionary' of the class. Because everything in Python is essentially a mapping (or dictionary) of functions/values to names, if you change the name __new__ within the right mapping, you change the nature of the object.</p>

<p>Problem is- every near-success I've had has it that if I call 'str( 'a' ).__new__( *args )' it works fine <em>{in some cases}</em>, but the calling of varOne = 'a' does not seem to actually call str.__new__().</p>

<p>My guess- this has something to do with either python's parsing of a program prior to launch, or else the caching of the various classes during/post launch. Or maybe I'm totally off the mark. Either python pre-reads and applies some regex to it's modules prior to launch or else the machine code, when it attempts to <strong><em>implicitly</em></strong> create an object, it reaches for something other than the class located in moduleObject.builtins[ __classname__ ]</p>
