47954784,"I'm in the midst of building a Django app and am hoping to get some advice on the proper way to handle errors and bugs in my code.  Here's a common situation exemplary of the problems I have: a user purchases a product. To process the purchase, my views need to perform a number of actions:   First, the view should create a  object in the database. If that is successful, the view should create an  object and    assign it to the newly-created User. If that is successful, my code should create a  object and add it to the newly created Order.   This is all well and good when no errors occur - but I find that the occasional error is inevitable in my code, and I want my app to deal with errors gracefully, rather than crashing outright. For example, if, for any reason, an  object cannot be created, the view should show the user an error and remove the  object that was previously created. And, it should throw a graceful error message rather than crashing outright and serving the user a Http 500 error.  The only way I can think of to do this is an extremely complex series of nested try / except clauses, like below. But designing my code this way is extremely messy and time-consuming, and it doesn't feel like the right way to do things.

An example assignment is where I want students to write two functions - one called  that adds an element to the list so that the list remains sorted, and another called  which returns a new list and uses  for sorting.  My access to the students' code is through unit test cases, in which I can call these functions. The problem is that in the  function, students can use  method and in the  function, they can use  built-in function.  It's easy to override the built-in functions (which in this case can raise an exception with the message that their use is not allowed). I can also override objects and functions in built-in modules (e.g., I needed to prevent the use of  function). But I cannot replace the method of a built-in type, like in the code below:    I get the error:    Is there a way to ban the use of specific methods in built-in classes? ",1
