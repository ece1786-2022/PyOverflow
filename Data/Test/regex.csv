Then read the chars between the current seek position and pos+123 (store them in a list or whatever).  Then seek until the next match for ':path,' and repeat the process.</p>

<p>I would like a function a bit like:</p>

<pre>
def fregseek(FILE, current_seek, /regex/):

.

  value_found = ?  # result of reading next N chars after :path,[0-9]+
.
.
  return next_start_seek, value_found

<p>There may be any number of matches for ':path,' in a line, and that string may occur within the number of chars specified after ','.  I have written a messy bunch of rubbish which reads in each line, then for each line chomps of the first N chars indicated by the match, then continues processing the string until it is all eaten up. Then reads the next string and so on.</p>

<p>This is horrible, I do not want to have to slurp off all the lines from a potentially huge file when all I really need to do is seek (especially since a newline is irrelevant, so having an extra processing step just because lines are easy to pull from files is ridiculous).</p>

<p>So, there it is, that is my problem that I would like to solve.  I need to seek to a match, read a value, continue from the end of that value looking for the next match and so on until the file is exhausted.</p>

<p>If anybody can help me with this I will be happy to hear from them :)</p>

<p>I would like to avoid non-standard libraries if possible, I would also like the shortest code but this is the least of my concerns (speed and memory consumption are the important factors, but I don't want 50 loc extra just to bootstrap some library with a small funciton in it I could just rip out if only I knew what it was).</p>

<p>I would prefer python code, however, if perl beats python in this regard I will use perl instead, I am also open to clever sed/awk/bash scripts etc as long as they are not horribly slower.</p>

I have created Python and Perl scripts that load log files and parse each line to save them to a MySQL database (the file contains about 40,000 lines, about 7MB). It took <strong>1 min 2 secs using Perl</strong> and only <strong>17 secs using Python</strong>. I had supposed that Perl would be faster than Python, as Perl is the original text processing language (my suspicions also coming from different blogs where I was reading about Perl text processing performance). Also I was not expecting a 47 second difference between Perl and Python. Why is Perl taking more time than Python to process my log file? Is it because I am using some wrong db module or my code and regular expression for Perl can be improved?</p>

<p><strong>Note:</strong> I am a Java and Groovy developer and I have no experience with Perl (I am using Strawberry Perl v5.16). Also I have made this test with Java (1 min 5 secs) and Groovy (1 min 7 secs) but more than 1 min to process the log file is too much, so both languages are out and now I want to choose between Perl and Python.</p>

<p><strong>this is what I tried</strong>:</p>

print ""\n This is the weird triple\n""
print weird_triple
</code></pre>

<p>The problem with this aproach is that returns a list of the pattern <code>RN_ _ _ _</code>, <code>VA_ _ _ _</code>, <code>VM_ _ _</code>, but without the one after another order(some ids and words between this pattern are being matched). Any idea of how to fix this in order to obtain:</p>

<pre><code>[('no RN', 'estar VASI1S0', 'lavar VMP00SM'),('estar VAIP2S0','condicionar VMP00SM', 'alla VASI1S0')]
</code></pre>

<p><strong>Thanks in advance guys!</strong></p>

<p><strong>UPDATE</strong>
I tried the aproaches that other uses recommend me but the problem is that if I add another one after another pattern like:</p>

<pre><code>no no RN 0.998134
estás estar VAIP2S0 1
condicionado condicionar VMP00SM 0.491858
</code></pre>

<p>To the <code>s</code> string the recommended regex of this question doesnt work. They only catch:</p>

<pre><code>[('no RN', 'estar VASI1S0', 'lavar VMP00SM')]
</code></pre>

<p>Instead of:</p>

<pre><code>[('no RN', 'estar VASI1S0', 'lavar VMP00SM'),('estar VAIP2S0','condicionar VMP00SM', 'alla VASI1S0')]
</code></pre>

<p>Which is right. Any idea of how to reach the one after another pattern output:</p>

<p>Example</p>

<ul>
<li>match: CATGTGXXXXXXCACGTG</li>
<li>no match: CATGTGXXXCACGTG (because 3 letters between)</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Third</strong>, when a match is found, begin the next search from the end of the previous match, inclusive. Report index of each match.</p>

<p><strong>Example</strong>:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>input (spaces for readability): XXX CATGTG XXXXXX CATTTG XXXXXXX CACGTG XXX</p></li>
<li><p>workflow (spaces for readability):</p>

<ul>
<li>found match: CATGTG XXXXXX CATTTG</li>
<li><p>it starts at 3</p></li>
<li><p>resuming search at C in CATTTG</p></li>
<li><p>found match: CATTTG XXXXXXX CACGTG</p></li>
<li>it starts at 15</li>

for creating electronic moving images (as opposed to a [[movie
camera]], that earlier recorded the images on [[filmstock|film]]).
Originally developed for use in [[television studio]]s, they are now
also used for [[music video]]s, [[direct-to-video]] movies, corporate
and educational videos, marriage videos etc.</p>

I can formulate the problem as: Replace (a given) pattern in string even if (known) token would conflict.</p>

<p>Let's assume we have <em>my_string</em>: </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>I like green and <strong>PLUS</strong> blue beans!</p>
</blockquote>

<p><strong>PLUS</strong> represents the known token we want to ignore in case it is hindering a match.</p>

<p>We also have a variable pattern called <em>my_pattern</em> which can be any part of <em>my_string</em> except <strong>PLUS</strong> such as:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>1) green and blue</p>
  
  <p>2) green and blue beans</p>
  
  <p>3) I like green</p>
</blockquote>

<p>We know <strong>PLUS</strong> may occur somewhere in <em>my_string</em> and we don't know the position. Theoretically, <em>my_string</em> could also be: </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>I <strong>PLUS</strong> like green and blue beans!</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Since <em>my_pattern</em> can occur in form 1), 2), or 3), we also can't hardcode the solution using ORs. </p>

<p>The sought solution is something like: 
<em>my_string</em>.replace(<em>my_pattern</em>, ""red"") with the output for my_pattern:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>1) I like red beans!</p>
  
  <p>2) I like red!</p>
  
  <p>3) red and <strong>PLUS</strong> blue beans!</p>
</blockquote>

<p><em>my_pattern</em> shall match although the <strong>PLUS</strong> occurs in <em>my_string</em> (which might conflict with my_pattern). 
It is something like: match <em>my_pattern</em> and ignore <strong>PLUS</strong> in case it is hindering a match.</p>

<p>I cannot for the life of me work out what's going on. I've printed everything I can think of and it looks like the search term matches. I've tried multiple methods of replace, but have stuck with the simple replace example to show. </p>

<p>Code:</p>

<pre><code>x = 1            
answerlist = ['Oranges', 'Apples', 'Mangos', 'Cherries']

for a in answerlist:
    searchterm = '&lt;core:para&gt;ANSWER_' + str(x) +'&lt;/core:para&gt;'
    newdata = filedata.replace(searchterm, a)
    x=x+1
</code></pre>

<p>For the purpose of the example I've hardcoded the answerlist variable above, but this is dynamically created in a larger loop. </p>

<p>The expected result is:</p>

<p><code>&lt;core:para&gt;Oranges&lt;/core:para&gt;&lt;core:para&gt;2. Bilateral investment treaties&lt;/core:para&gt;&lt;core:para&gt;Apples&lt;/core:para&gt;</code>

<p>I've tested the pattern either side of x and that works fine, so the problem appears to be the x, somehow not converting into the string I think it is. </p>

<p>Any ideas what the problem might be?</p>

<pre><code>{
IP1: {

<p>I just am stuck in taking this information, and placing it into a dictionary of dictionaries with a count per each message.</p>

<p>I have a basic working prototype, where it stores {IP1: {message1}, IP2: {message2}, etc.} but it does not store additional messages if number is already in the dictionary. I am using Regex to filter out the noise, and focus only on the signal (what I need), which works without any problems. But I am tied up in the data-structure portion, and getting count for the messages.</p>

<h1>Final Update</h1>

<p>After watching some more videos, I just used the .split("":"", 1) function when appending to an array, and then created a Pandas Dataframe, adding one final column with count. From there, I did the necessary analysis for the problem I was trying to solve. Hope this helps anyone else in the future!</p>

<p>The number of values per key can vary. I want to extract the different key-value pairs, because I have to check whether they are formatted in a certain way.

<pre><code>(.*):\n(-\ .*\n)*

However after converting into executable with cx_freeze, it basically reads the file but cannot see any chinese chars , so no translation is being done.Can you please help ? </p>

However, I would like to do something slightly different than matching simple emoticons. I'm sorting through tweets that contain the emoticons' icons. The following unicode information contains just such emoticons: <a href=""http://www.unicode.org/charts/PDF/U1F600.pdf"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">pdf</a>.</p>
<p>Using a string with english words that also contains any of these emoticons from the <a href=""http://www.unicode.org/charts/PDF/U1F600.pdf"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">pdf</a>, I would like to be able to compare the number of emoticons to the number of words.</p>
<p>The direction that I was heading down doesn't seem to be the best option and I was looking for some help. As you can see in the script below, I was just planning to do the work from the command line:</p>
<pre><code>$cat &lt;file containing the strings with emoticons&gt; | ./emo.py
</code></pre>
<p>emo.py psuedo script:</p>
<pre><code>import re
import sys

for row in sys.stdin:
    print row.decode('utf-8').encode(&quot;ascii&quot;,&quot;replace&quot;)
    #insert regex to find the emoticons
    if match:
       #do some counting using .split(&quot; &quot;)
       #print the counting
</code></pre>
<p>The problem that I'm running into is the decoding/encoding. I haven't found a good option for how to encode/decode the string so I can correctly find the icons. An example of the string that I want to search to find the number of words and emoticons is as follows:</p>
<p>&quot;Smiley emoticon rocks!<img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/hOZzk.png"" alt=""enter image description here"" /> I like you<img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/jccuO.png"" alt=""enter image description here"" />.&quot;</p>
<p>The challenge: <strong>can you make a script that counts the number of words and emoticons in this string?</strong> Notice that the emoticons are both sitting next to the words with no space in between.</p>

<hr>

<p>The following code (<em>with</em> a replacement function) works but the use of global variables is a big problem here here because in fact <code>do_something_else()</code> can take a few milliseconds, and this process might be mixed with another concurrent run of <code>main()</code> :</p>

    global i, a, b
    a, b = do_something_else(a, b)
    i += 1
